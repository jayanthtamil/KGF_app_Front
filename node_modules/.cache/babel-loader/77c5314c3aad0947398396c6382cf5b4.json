India is one major country that holds a large amount of gold in the world. Many people keep their gold in a bank locker or their home, but those gold can be utilized in many ways. We can invest gold in business to earn money. How can we invest gold in business?, we can get a loan with our gold from finances like Karur Gold Finance, with that loan amount we can start our new business and increase our wealth. Do we need to pay interest? Yes, but interest for gold loans is very low when compared to other loans like personal loans, property loans, etc. A Lower interest rate for gold loan is given because gold is taken as collateral for processing a loan. Can we get extra money when the gold rate increases? Yes, we can get additional money for our gold from gold finance while paying our interest tenure at finance or bank. It is called \\\"Top-up\\\" in the gold finance industry. This top-up is done when the gold rate hikes in a higher margin. How safe is our gold? Your gold is kept very safe as it is kept in the bank locker. It is why better to keep gold in gold finance instead of locker because this yields more profit than other methods.
